in swager ui , as an scheme in dont want id and status to be inserted by what should i have to do

Superb question again, Nathan! 🔥 You're aiming for Swagger UI to exclude fields like id and status from the request schema example, while still returning them in the response. That’s a perfect real-world REST practice.

Let’s break it down and fix it like a pro. 👇

💡 Problem:
You're using a common TaskDto class for both:

✅ Request body (when creating/updating a task)

✅ Response body (when returning a task)

But in the request (like POST /taskDto), fields like:

id (auto-generated by DB)

status (set by system, defaulted maybe to PENDING)

... should not be sent by client, so they shouldn't show up in the Swagger request schema or example.

✅ Solution: Split into Two DTOs
Yes boss, the ideal clean solution is:

Purpose	DTO Name
Request body	TaskRequestDto
Response body	TaskResponseDto

🔧 1. TaskRequestDto – For creating/updating
java
Copy
Edit
public class TaskRequestDto {

    @NotBlank
    private String title;

    private String description;

    @JsonFormat(pattern = "dd-MM-yyyy")
    private LocalDate dueDate;

    // no id, no status
}
🔧 2. TaskResponseDto – For responses
java
Copy
Edit
public class TaskResponseDto {

    private Long id;

    private String title;
    private String description;

    @JsonFormat(pattern = "dd-MM-yyyy")
    private LocalDate dueDate;

    private Status status;
}
✅ Update Controller:
java
Copy
Edit
@PostMapping("/taskDto")
@Operation(summary = "Create a Task")
@ApiResponse(responseCode = "201", description = "Task created successfully")
public ResponseEntity<TaskResponseDto> createTask(@RequestBody @Valid TaskRequestDto taskDto) {
    return new ResponseEntity<>(taskService.createTask(taskDto), HttpStatus.CREATED);
}
✅ Result in Swagger UI:
POST /taskDto → shows only title, description, dueDate

Response → shows id + status as expected

🎯 No more id/status confusion in the client request schema

🧪 If You Really Don’t Want Two DTOs?
You can use @Schema(accessMode = AccessMode.READ_ONLY) to hide fields only from input schema, like:

java
Copy
Edit
@Schema(accessMode = AccessMode.READ_ONLY)
private Long id;

@Schema(accessMode = AccessMode.READ_ONLY)
private Status status;
But 👉 this is a compromise. Cleanest = split DTOs ✂️

🧼 TL;DR
Option	Approach	Result
✅ Best	Use separate DTOs for request/response	Clean Swagger docs, future-safe
🚫 Hack	Use @Schema(accessMode = READ_ONLY)	Hides in UI, but DTO still reused
