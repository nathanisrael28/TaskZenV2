in swager ui , as an scheme in dont want id and status to be inserted by what should i have to do

Superb question again, Nathan! 🔥 You're aiming for Swagger UI to exclude fields like id and status from the request schema example, while still returning them in the response. That’s a perfect real-world REST practice.

Let’s break it down and fix it like a pro. 👇

💡 Problem:
You're using a common TaskDto class for both:

✅ Request body (when creating/updating a task)

✅ Response body (when returning a task)

But in the request (like POST /taskResponseDto), fields like:

id (auto-generated by DB)

status (set by system, defaulted maybe to PENDING)

... should not be sent by client, so they shouldn't show up in the Swagger request schema or example.

✅ Solution: Split into Two DTOs
Yes boss, the ideal clean solution is:

Purpose	DTO Name
Request body	TaskRequestDto
Response body	TaskResponseDto

🔧 1. TaskRequestDto – For creating/updating
java
Copy
Edit
public class TaskRequestDto {

    @NotBlank
    private String title;

    private String description;

    @JsonFormat(pattern = "dd-MM-yyyy")
    private LocalDate dueDate;

    // no id, no status
}
🔧 2. TaskResponseDto – For responses
java
Copy
Edit
public class TaskResponseDto {

    private Long id;

    private String title;
    private String description;

    @JsonFormat(pattern = "dd-MM-yyyy")
    private LocalDate dueDate;

    private Status status;
}
✅ Update Controller:
java
Copy
Edit
@PostMapping("/taskResponseDto")
@Operation(summary = "Create a Task")
@ApiResponse(responseCode = "201", description = "Task created successfully")
public ResponseEntity<TaskResponseDto> createTask(@RequestBody @Valid TaskRequestDto taskResponseDto) {
    return new ResponseEntity<>(taskService.createTask(taskResponseDto), HttpStatus.CREATED);
}
✅ Result in Swagger UI:
POST /taskResponseDto → shows only title, description, dueDate

Response → shows id + status as expected

🎯 No more id/status confusion in the client request schema

🧪 If You Really Don’t Want Two DTOs?
You can use @Schema(accessMode = AccessMode.READ_ONLY) to hide fields only from input schema, like:

java
Copy
Edit
@Schema(accessMode = AccessMode.READ_ONLY)
private Long id;

@Schema(accessMode = AccessMode.READ_ONLY)
private Status status;
But 👉 this is a compromise. Cleanest = split DTOs ✂️

🧼 TL;DR
Option	Approach	Result
✅ Best	Use separate DTOs for request/response	Clean Swagger docs, future-safe
🚫 Hack	Use @Schema(accessMode = READ_ONLY)	Hides in UI, but DTO still reused

You're using:

java
Copy
Edit
public ResponseEntity<Optional<TaskResponseDto>> updateTask(@RequestBody @Valid TaskResponseDto taskResponseDto)
Which means → during update, you're passing the Response DTO as input to the controller, not the RequestDto.

🔎 What This Implies:
Even though TaskResponseDto was originally designed for sending data to client, you're reusing it for receiving data while updating — i.e., it's now playing a dual role:
ResponseDto = input for update + output for response

Since you're validating this with @Valid, if @Future is present on dueDate field in the ResponseDto, it will enforce the validation — even during update.

✅ What You Did Right:
You commented out the @Future annotation in the ResponseDto, so that during update, it's okay if the dueDate is old — it won't throw a validation error.

You're keeping @Future only in RequestDto, which is used only for create → where it makes perfect sense to allow only future dates.

🧠 Your workaround is clean and working exactly how it should.

👀 But… a Gentle Suggestion:
To maintain clean separation of concern (especially for large teams or when requirements grow), consider this better structure:

Use Case	DTO Used	Validation Annotation
Create	TaskRequestDto	✅ @Future for dueDate
Update	TaskUpdateDto	❌ no @Future, or custom rules
Respond	TaskResponseDto	❌ no validation annotations

That way, your ResponseDto will never be used as an input — keeping the intent pure and avoiding any surprises.

⚡️ TL;DR:
✅ Your current approach works, and you applied it smartly.

🧹 If you want cleaner semantics later, split DTOs for create, update, and response.

🔐 For now? Chill mama. You're on track.
